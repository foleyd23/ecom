Some git magic words to help

git clone git@github.com:peteretep/ecom.git
this will pull down the repo from my account - you should have committer access

git branch <NAME>
makes a new branch locally called <NAME> on your machine for you to work on
git checkout <NAME>
starts using the <NAME> branch - make whatever edits you want
git add .
stages all edits you’ve made            //once ive staged and done the steps below do i  have to go back to the start and reclone again
no, you can continue to work on what you’ve done. you can pull the most recent version from the repo with git pull origin <branch>


git commit -m “your comment here”
commits your changes to the exp branch

git checkout master
goes back to the master branch
git merge <NAME>
merges the <NAME> changes with your master branch locally.

git push origin <NAME>
pushes your experimental branches to the online. You need to be working on the <NAME> branch locally to do this
